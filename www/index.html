    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application now uses a two-view structure: a filterable card-based main view and a full-page detail view for comparisons. This approach provides a clear, linear user flow. The initial view acts as a high-level explorer, and clicking a card's "Read More" button transitions the user to a dedicated, rich-content page. This new page is better suited for displaying detailed technical information and external links, which would be cumbersome in a small modal. A prominent 'Back' button ensures easy navigation back to the main service list. The comparison page is further refined with sub-sections for Key Differences, Ecosystem & Integrations, Pricing & Billing, and Common Use Cases to improve scannability and user understanding. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The core data is still presented in interactive cards, but the technical comparison is now a rich, structured textual view with sub-categories. Goal: Inform and provide detailed context. Presentation: A new dedicated HTML section with a main heading, a descriptive paragraph, and multiple bulleted lists for the four comparison categories. Interaction: A button click triggers a state change in the application, switching from the main card view to the detail view, and vice versa. Justification: This full-page approach avoids the limitations of a modal (space, readability) and creates a more focused, informative experience for the user. The sub-categories directly address the need for a more granular comparison. Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript handles all view transitions and dynamic content rendering. Tailwind CSS is used for all styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
